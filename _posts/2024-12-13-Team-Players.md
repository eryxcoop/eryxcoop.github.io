## Who are we?
We are Eryx, a technology cooperative from Argentina.
We specialize in tailor-made software, cryptography and computer vision.

## Traditional organizational models

What are the main ways people typically work?
Most answers converge on one of two traditional options:

1. Employer-employee relationships.
2. Freelancing.

### Employer-Employee Relationships

This is the most widespread model.
Companies operating this way are hierarchical, with higher-ups delegating tasks through orders.

### Freelancing

Freelancing is often chosen by those who want independence.
Entrepreneurs in this model start businesses based on a profitable skill or hobby.
But what if we don't want to work within these structures?
What if we don't want to be employees or freelancers?
Let's explore an alternative by sharing our story.

## A story of an alternative

### Beginnings

Agustin and Lucho met at the University of Buenos Aires while studying computer science.
To break into the software development industry, they started working together, programming for small entrepreneurs.
They worked from home, using their own computers.
Clients came through personal connections.
These projects helped them apply what they'd learned at university while also teaching them about management, sales, and finance.
Their trust and friendship allowed them to work comfortably, and their entrepreneurship gradually expanded.
As demand for their services grew, they realized they needed more people.
However, they didn't want employees or a traditional hierarchy.
They wanted peers — equals who could share in decision-making within a transparent, egalitarian environment.
They reached out to trusted university friends who shared their principles.
Together, they decided which projects to take, which technologies to use, how to form teams, and how to distribute profits.
The team continued to grow, and with that growth came the need for a structure to organize their work, manage billing, and maintain the horizontal nature of their organization.
Their key principles emerged:

1. No hierarchy. No bosses.
2. Nobody works alone.
3. Everyone participates in decisions democratically.
4. They value collective well-being, respect, and collaboration.

### The chosen organizational model

The team searched for a legal structure that fit their values.
Someone mentioned they were already functioning like a **cooperative**.
But what does that mean?
A cooperative is defined as an _autonomous association of individuals who voluntarily unite to meet their shared economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically governed enterprise_.
This aligned perfectly with their ideals.
Despite some initial doubts — such as concerns about profitability or client perceptions — they decided to explore further.
With this framework in mind, the team officially registered their company as a cooperative with the National Institute of Cooperativism and Social Economy (INAES) in Buenos Aires.
They divided formal roles (e.g., President, Secretary, Treasurer) but distributed responsibilities among all members.

### The organizational model in practice

The cooperative continued to grow, moving into its own office and introducing specialized departments:

- Accounting and Administration
- Communication
- Talent and People
- Sales
- Academy
- Design
- Labs
  
Labs, for instance, was created by a member passionate about research and development.
It led to projects like sending a box to space and developing an educational math app for children.
To ensure transparency and collaboration, the team established regular meetings to share project updates and departmental progress.

## Final notes

Our group, Eryx, is now a cooperative of over 36 members, including PhDs, university teachers, and professionals from various fields.
We've worked with over 50 clients worldwide, focusing on Cryptography, Computer Vision, and Education.
Above all, we remain horizontal and transparent.
We have been working this way for 13 years, and we are incredibly proud of what we have built together.
