## Who are we?

We are Eryx, a workers' cooperative from Argentina.  
We specialize in tailor-made software, cryptography, and computer vision.

## Traditional organizational models

We’d like to introduce you to a different organizational model — one based more on cooperation than competition.  
But first, let’s reflect on what we already know: What are the main ways people typically work?  
Most answers converge on one of two traditional options:
1. Employer-employee relationships.
2. Freelancing.

### Employer-Employee Relationships

This is the most widespread model. Companies operating this way are hierarchical, with higher-ups delegating tasks through orders.  
Employees are told what to do, when to do it, and sometimes even how to do it. Decision-making is concentrated at the top, while employees focus on execution.  
Compensation is usually fixed, while company profits remain with the owners. Most banks and supermarkets follow this model.

### Freelancing

Freelancing is often chosen by those who want independence. Entrepreneurs in this model start businesses based on a profitable skill or hobby.  
Some professionals, such as psychologists and artisans, also offer services independently. Freelancers organize their own work and retain all profits.

But what if we don’t want to work within these structures?  
What if we don’t want to be employees or freelancers?  
Let’s explore an alternative by sharing our story.

## A story of an alternative

### Beginnings

Two friends and Computer Science students at the University of Buenos Aires started programming together to enter the software development industry.  
They worked from home, using their own computers. Their early projects were small: a landing page for a small business, a system for a real estate company, and another for a print shop.  
Clients came through personal connections. These projects helped them apply what they’d learned at university while also teaching them about management, sales, and finance.  
Their trust and friendship allowed them to work comfortably, and their entrepreneurship gradually expanded.

As demand for their services grew, they realized they needed more people. However, they didn’t want employees or a traditional hierarchy. They wanted peers — equals who could share in decision-making within a transparent, egalitarian environment.  
They reached out to trusted university friends who shared their principles. Together, they decided which projects to take, which technologies to use, how to form teams, and how to distribute profits.

The team continued to grow. When their home office became too small, they moved into a coworking space. Growth also brought the need for a structure to organize work, billing, and the horizontal nature of their organization.

Their key principles emerged:
1. No hierarchy. No bosses.
2. Nobody works alone.
3. Everyone participates in decisions democratically.
4. They value collective well-being, respect, and collaboration.

### The chosen organizational model

The team searched for a legal structure that fit their values. Someone in their coworking space mentioned they were already functioning like a **cooperative**. But what does that mean?

A cooperative is defined as an _autonomous association of individuals who voluntarily unite to meet their shared economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically governed enterprise._  
This aligned perfectly with their ideals.

Despite some initial doubts — such as concerns about profitability or client perceptions — they decided to explore further. They learned that cooperatives originated in 1844 England, when the Rochdale Pioneers organized to address food crises during the Industrial Revolution.  
The Pioneers established principles that remain relevant today, such as:

- **Voluntary and Open Membership**: No discrimination based on race, politics, religion, social status, or gender.
- **Democratic Member Control**: A principle established even before universal suffrage!
- **Member Economic Participation**: Members share profits.
- **Autonomy and Independence**: Cooperatives remain self-governed.
- **Education, Training, and Information**: Continuous learning is essential.
- **Cooperation Among Cooperatives**: Collaboration replaces competition.
- **Concern for Community and Environment**: Cooperatives aim for sustainable development.

With this framework in mind, the team officially registered their company as a cooperative with the National Institute of Cooperativism and Social Economy (INAES) in Buenos Aires.  
They divided formal roles (e.g., President, Secretary, Treasurer) but distributed responsibilities among all members.

### The organizational model in practice

The cooperative continued to grow, moving into its own office and introducing specialized departments:

- Accounting and Administration
- Communication
- Talent and People
- Sales
- Academy
- Design
- Labs

Labs, for instance, was created by a member passionate about research and development. It led to projects like sending a box to space and developing an educational math app for children.

To ensure transparency and collaboration, the team established regular meetings to share project updates and departmental progress.

Decision-making is democratic, with two types identified:
- **Low-impact decisions**: Easily reversible and low-cost, handled by specific departments or quick consensus.
- **High-impact decisions**: Long-term, costly, or high-stakes decisions require formal proposals and voting.

## Final notes

Our group, Eryx, is now a cooperative of over 35 members, including PhDs, university teachers, and professionals from various fields.  
We’ve worked with over 50 clients worldwide, focusing on Cryptography, Computer Vision, and Education.  
Above all, we remain horizontal and transparent.

If you’re considering starting your own company, remember: a cooperative is a fantastic option!
